## User Stories
What is Coding PAL's? 

As a user you will start at the home page and see your favorite Coding PAL and their dog(s). From there you can select what you would like to know more about, the Coding PAL or their fury friend. In the Coding PAL link you will find a brief profile about the PAL and a link to their dog. Users will be able to learn more about our pets and their daily lives. This will include pictures of our dogs, their schedules, their friends, and whatever else a dog does. 

In later interations, we would like to open our website to all of our Purple Lavendeer friends to add their pets!
