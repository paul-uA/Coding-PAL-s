# Coding-PAL-s
## About Our Website
Its a website all about our Dogs! Follow us on our coding journey with our dogs. This website will showcase our loving dogs and give a brief insight into who we are. 

## Wireframe
![](pictures/wireFrameCodingPal.png)
The wireframe above gives a generic outline of how navigation of the site should work. The home page introduces the PALS and our pets. The owner's name is followed by the pet's name. If you click the name of the owner you will be taken to their profile to give a short description of who they are and other things.If they click the dogs name they are taken to the dogs page where they can see a picture of the dog and more information about them. There will also be a feature to give the dog a bone and “like” the picture. If development reaches MVP there will be an accompanying schedule for the pets that shows important dates and activities. Also if we can there will be a login on the home page to add your name to the pals as well as your pet. 

## User Stories
What is Coding PAL's? 

As a user you will start at the home page and see your favorite Coding PAL and their dog(s). From there you can select what you would like to know more about, the Coding PAL or their fury friend. In the Coding PAL link you will find a brief profile about the PAL and a link to their dog. Users will be able to learn more about our pets and their daily lives. This will include pictures of our dogs, their schedules, their friends, and whatever else a dog does. 

In later interations, we would like to open our website to all of our Purple Lavendeer friends to add their pets!
